## 🚀 Usage
### For Users or Testers
Just go to the [releases page](https://github.com/frostygg/desktop/releases) and download the exe or dmg for the latest release (depending if you're on Windows or Mac).
Windows builds only support x64 systems.

If you're testing, you might want a build of the latest commit. AppVeyor automatically builds each commit, and you can get those builds [here](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/daniel11420/backdesktop/build/artifacts).

### For Developers
You need [node.js](https://nodejs.org). The latest version is recommended but others work too.

Installation:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/frostygg/desktop
cd desktop
npm i
npm start
```
Building:
```sh
npm run make-win
npm run make-mac
```
